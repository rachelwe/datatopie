# Datatopie : A simple and lightweight vanillaJS graph library

This project is a work in progress, it can be used to generate line, pie & donut graph.
It is very regularly broken because of multiple experimentations, do not use it in production as-is but you can take it as an inspiration if you want to make your own graphs :)

## TODOs
- [ ] single exported file for a common base
- [ ] separate exports depending on graph needed (only line, only donut etc.)
- [ ] cleanup the comments
- [ ] document the thing
- [ ] refactoring, refactoring, refactoring...
